# Abstract
Add a class template, indirect_value, to the standard library to support indirect objects with value-like semantics.

# Introduction
The class template, indirect_value, confers value-like semantics on a freestore allocated object. A indirect_value may hold an object of a class T, copying the indirect_value will copy the object of T, and constness will propagate from the owning classes to the indirect_value type.

## Motivation
In C++, when anything in a class definition changes
The Pimpl idiom has become a well known engineering paradigm in the C++ world

## Completeness
Recommended practice for implementation of a Pimpl classes since C++11 has been to store the Pimpl in a std::unique_ptr [H.Sutter] and [S.Meyers]. Smart pointer types in the Standard Library expect that some of the members can be instantiated with incomplete types [H.Hinnant]. Similarly this is the case for indirect_value.

# Technical specifications

X.X Class template default_copy [default.copy]
```
namespace std {
    template <class T>
    struct default_copy {
        T* operator()(const T& t) const;
    };
} // namespace std
```
The class template default_copy serves as the default copier for the class
template polymorphic_value.
The template parameter <code>T</code> of <code>default_copy</code> may be an incomplete type.

<code>T* operator()(const T& t) const<code>;
* Returns: new T(t)
