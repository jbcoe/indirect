# Abstract
Add a class template, indirect_value, to the C++ Standard Library to support free-store-allocated objects with value
-like semantics.

# Introduction
The class template, `indirect_value`, confers value-like semantics on a free-store-allocated object. An indirect_value may hold an object of a class T, copying the `indirect_value` will copy the object `T`, and `const`ness will propagate from the owning classes to the `indirect_value` type.

## Motivation - a perfect PImpl
In C++, when anything in a class definition changes, dependent classes require recompilation. As early as 1992 the Handle/Body idiom was suggested to break this dependency [J. Coplien]. From this pattern, the PImpl idiom was specialised [H. Sutter 98].  Almost three decades on since these ideas started circulating implementation of the PImpl idiom requires thought about implementation details around copying and to support this feature requires user intervention. 

```
// Header file
class widget {
public:
    widget();
    ~widget();
private:
    class impl;
    std::unique_ptr<impl> pimpl_;
};
 
// Implementation file
class widget::impl {
    // :::
};
 
widget::widget() : pimpl_{ std::make_unique<impl>( /*...*/  } { }
widget::~widget() = default;
```
For convenience, the widget class will be referred to as the “visible class” and impl class the “<code>PImpl</code> class”. Note, semantically the <code>PImpl</code> class is the implementation details of the visible class.

### Issues with `unique_ptr<impl>` implementation of PImpl Idiom
#### const-propagation

Using <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to store the implementation object introduces an issue: within a `const`-qualified member function, an instance of the visible class can mutate data inside the implementation object.  This is because <code>const</code> qualification applies only to the `unique_ptr` value, and not the pointed-to-object.  

The compiler is unable to give thread-compatibility guarantees for `const` objects when
`const` is not propagated - `const` does not mean immutable in the face of pointer-like-member data.

The desired semantics of a PImpl-owner are value-like, like those of `std::optional` which has appropriate `const`- and non-`const`-qualified overloads
for `operator*` and `operator->`. 

#### copies
The copy-constructor and copy-assignment operator of `std::unique_ptr` are deleted. Users of a class with a `std::unique_ptr` member will be required to implement copy-construction and copy-assignment.  Implementation of these methods for a class with PImpl members is non-trivial [S. Meyers].

### Issues with `polymorphic_value<impl>` implementation of PImpl Idiom
The class template `polymorphic_value` confers value-like semantics on a free-store-allocated object. This satisfies our
requirement for const-propagation and a compiler generated copy constructor and copy assignment operator but incurs an additional cost in supporting polymorphism.
To implement deep copies of subclasses, `polymorphic_value` employs type-erasure which has run-time cost due to
virtual dispatch and memory indirection. We do not need to support polymorphism for our PImpl object and should not pay for what we do not use.

### Perfect Implementation of the PImpl Idiom
Like `polymorphic_value`, `indirect_value` confers value-like semantics on a free-store-allocated object. Unlike
 `polymorphic_value`,
`indirect_value` does not support polymorphism - `indirect_value<T>` is either empty or contains an object of type `T`.

```
// Header file
class widget {
public:
    widget();
    widget(widget&& rhs) noexcept;
    widget(const widget& rhs);
    widget& operator=(widget&& rhs) noexcept;
    widget& operator=(const widget& rhs);
    ~widget();
private:
    class impl;
    std::indirect_value<impl>> pimpl;
};
 
// Implementation file
class widget::impl {
    // :::
};

// Force instantiation of the rule of zero methods in the translation unit where implementation details are known.
widget::widget(widget&& rhs) noexcept = default;
widget::widget(const widget& rhs) = default;
widget& widget::operator=(widget&& rhs) noexcept = default;
widget& widget::operator=(const widget& rhs) = default;
widget::~widget() = default;
```

Now the visible class has compiler-generated copy and move constructors, copy and move assignment operators and destructor.  All of these compiler-generated functions will behave correctly.  

## Prior Art
There have been previous proposal for deep-copying smart pointers that proposed copy semantics [W. Brown]. <code>cloned_ptr</code> was proposed in [J. Coe], however under guidance of LEWG this was renamed to <code>polymorphic_value</code>.  With this change in name came the addition of const propagation.

This paper is not unique in these ideas. GitHub code search finds 602k lines of code referencing "PImpl" and 99 C++ repositories claiming to provide generic implementations of Pimpl.  Additionally other authors have addressed this topic [A. Upadyshev].

## Completeness of T*
Recommended practice for pointer-to-implementation of PImpl classes since C++11 has been to store the pointer-to-implementation in a std::unique_ptr [S. Meyers]. Smart pointer types in the Standard Library expect that some of the members can be instantiated with incomplete types [H.Hinnant]. Similarly, this is the case for indirect_value, the table outlines the expected behaviour for incomplete pointer types:

## Impact on the standard
This proposal is a pure library extension. It requires additions to be made to the standard library header &lt;memory&gt;.

# Technical specifications

## X.X Class template default_copy [default.copy]
```
namespace std {
    template <class T>
    struct default_copy {
        T* operator()(const T& t) const;
    };
} // namespace std
```
The class template default_copy serves as the default copier for the class
template indirect_value.
The template parameter <code>T</code> of <code>default_copy</code> may be an incomplete type.

<code>T* operator()(const T& t) const;</code>
* Returns: <code>new T(t);</code>

## X.Y Class template indirect_value [indirect_value]
### X.Y.1 Class template indirect_value general [indirect_value.general]
An indirect_value is an object that owns another object and manages that other object through a pointer. More precisely, an indirect value is an object **v** that stores a pointer to a second object **p** and will dispose of **p** when **v** is itself destroyed (e.g., when leaving block scope (9.7)). In this context, **v** is said to own **p**.

An indirect_value object is empty if it does not own a pointer.

Copying a non-empty indirect_value will copy the owned object so that the copied indirect_value will have its own unique copy of the owned object.

Copying from an empty indirect_value produces another empty indirect_value.

Copying and disposal of the owned object can be customised by supplying a copier and deleter.

The template parameter T of indirect_value must be a non-union class type.

The template parameter T of indirect_value may be an incomplete type.

*[Note: Implementations are encouraged to avoid the use of dynamic memory for ownership of small objects.]*

### X.Y.2 Class template indirect_value synopsis [indirect_value.synopsis]

```
    template <class T, class C = std::default_copy<T>, class D = std::default_delete<T>>
    class indirect_value {
    public:
        using value_type = T;

        // Constructors
        constexpr indirect_value() noexcept;
        explicit indirect_value(T* p, C c=C{}, D d=D{});

        indirect_value(const indirect_value& p);
        indirect_value(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;

        template <class ...Ts>
        indirect_value(std::in_place_t, Ts&&... ts);

        // Destructor
        ~indirect_value();

        // Assignment
        indirect_value& operator=(const indirect_value& p);
        indirect_value& operator=(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;

        // Modifiers
        void swap(indirect_value<T>& p) noexcept;

        // Observers
        T& operator*();
        T* operator->();
        const T& operator*() const;
        const T* operator->() const;
        explicit operator bool() const noexcept;
    };

    // indirect_value creation
    template <class T, class ...Ts> indirect_value<T>
    make_indirect_value(Ts&& ...ts);

    // indirect_value specialized algorithms
    template<class T>
    void swap(indirect_value<T>& p, indirect_value<T>& u) noexcept;

} // end namespace std

```

### X.Y.3 Class template indirect_value constructors [indirect_value.ctor]

<code>constexpr indirect_value() noexcept;</code>
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.
* Effects: Constructs an empty indirect_value.
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == false

<code>explicit indirect_value(T* p, C c=C{}, D d=D{});</code>
* Effects: Creates an indirect_value object that owns the pointer p. If p is non-null then the copier and deleter of the indirect_value constructed are moved from c and d.
* Requires: C and D satisfy the requirements of CopyConstructible. If p is non-null then the expression c(*p) returns an object of type T*. The expression d(p) is well-formed, has well-defined behaviour, and does not throw exceptions. 
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == bool(p).
* Remarks: A custom copier and deleter are said to be ‘present’ in a indirect_value initialised with this constructor.

<code>indirect_value(const indirect_value& p);</code>
* Constraints: is_copy_constructible_v<T>
* Effects: Creates a indirect_value object that owns a copy of the object managed by p. The copy is created by the copier in p. If p has a custom copier and deleter then the custom copier and deleter of the indirect_value constructed are copied from those in p.
* Throws: Any exception thrown by the copier or bad_alloc if required storage cannot be obtained.
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == bool(p).

<code>indirect_value(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;</code>
* Effects: Move-constructs an indirect_value instance from p. If p has a custom copier and deleter then the copier and deleter of the indirect_value constructed are the same as those in p.
* Postconditions: *this contains the old value of p. p is empty.
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.

<code>indirect_value(std::in_place_t, Ts&& ...ts);</code>
* Effects: Constructs an `indirect_value` which owns an object of type `T` direct-non-list-initialized with `std::forward<Ts>(ts)...`
* Throws: Any exception thrown by the selected constructor of `T` or `bad_alloc` if required storage cannot be obtained.

### X.Y.4 Class template indirect_value destructor [indirect_value.dtor]
<code>~indirect_value();</code>
* Effects: If get() == nullptr there are no effects. If a custom deleter d is present then d(p) is called and the copier and deleter are destroyed. Otherwise the destructor of the managed object is called.

### X.Y.5 Class template indirect_value assignment [indirect_value.assignment]
<code>indirect_value& operator=(const indirect_value& p);</code>
* Constraints: is_copy_assignable<T>
* Effects: *this owns a copy of the resource managed by p. If p has a custom copier and deleter then the copy is created by the copier in p, and the copier and deleter of *this are copied from those in p. Otherwise, the resource managed by *this is initialised by the copy constructor of the resource managed by p.
* Throws: Any exception thrown by the copier or bad_alloc if required storage cannot be obtained.
* Returns: *this.
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == bool(p).

<code>indirect_value& operator=(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;</code>
* Effects: Ownership of the resource managed by p is transferred to this. If p has a custom copier and deleter then the copier and deleter of *this is the same as those in p.
* Returns: *this.
* Postconditions: *this contains the old value of p. p is empty.

### X.Y.6 Class template indirect_value modifiers [indirect_value.modifiers]
<code>void swap(indirect_value<T>& p) noexcept;</code>
* Effects: Exchanges the contents of p and *this.
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.

### X.Y.7 Class template indirect_value observers [indirect_value.observers]
```
T& operator*();
const T& operator*() const;
```
* Requires: bool(*this).
* Returns: A reference to the owned object.

```
T* operator->() noexcept;
const T* operator->() const noexcept;
```
* Requires: bool(*this).
* Returns: A pointer to the owned object. 
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.

<code>explicit operator bool() const noexcept;</code>
* Returns: false if the indirect_value is empty, otherwise true.
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.

### X.Z.8 Class template `indirect_value` creation [indirect_value.creation]

```cpp
template <class T, class U=T, class ...Ts> indirect_value<T>
  make_indirect_value(Ts&& ...ts);
```

* Constraints: `is_constructible_v<U, Ts...>` is true.
* Expects: `U` meets the `Cpp17CopyConstructible` requirements.
* Returns: A `indirect_value<T>` owning an object of type ``
  direct-non-list-initialized with `std::forward<Ts>(ts)...`.
