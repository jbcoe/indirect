# Abstract
Add a class template, indirect_value, to the standard library to support indirect objects with value-like semantics.
# Introduction
The class template, indirect_value, confers value-like semantics on a freestore allocated object. An indirect_value may hold an object of a class T, copying the indirect_value will copy the object of T, and constness will propagate from the owning classes to the indirect_value type.

## Motivation

The C++ standard includes support for numerous smart pointer templates, with support for new addition ongoing [Meneide et al].  One common use for these types is as the pointer-to-implementation in the Pimpl idiom [H.Sutter]. When the application design requires deep-copy semantic when the type is moved, existing pointer types, <code>std::unique_ptr</code> and <code>std::shared_ptr</code> are not the correct tool for the job.

One option for value semantics is the use of <code>std::experimental::polymophic_value</code>. However, <code>polymophic_value</code> provides a solution to the *polymorphic copying problem*, which requires the use of type-erasure.  Such implementation details incur a cost. However, use of the Pimpl idiom will likely not involve polymorphic types.  As such using <code>polymophic_value</code> means paying for features that are not used.

In this case, what is needed is value semantics for an indirectly owned value.  This paper proposes the <code>indirect_value</code> template for future standardisation. The issues to be addressed will be examined in further detail, prior art on the subject will be discussed and finally, open questions posed.

## Deep Copying
## Pimpl
In C++, when anything in a class definition changes
The Pimpl idiom has become a well-known engineering paradigm in the C++ world

## Why polymophic_value does not solve this problem, i.e. not paying for what you don't use.


## Completeness of T*
Recommended practice for pointer-to-implementation of Pimpl classes since C++11 has been to store the pointer-to-implementation in a std::unique_ptr [S. Meyers]. Smart pointer types in the Standard Library expect that some of the members can be instantiated with incomplete types [H.Hinnant]. Similarly, this is the case for indirect_value, the table outlines the expected behaviour for incomplete types:

## Impact on the standard
This proposal is a pure library extension. It requires additions to be made to the standard library header <memory>.

# Technical specifications

## X.X Class template default_copy [default.copy]
```
namespace std {
    template <class T>
    struct default_copy {
        T* operator()(const T& t) const;
    };
} // namespace std
```
The class template default_copy serves as the default copier for the class
template polymorphic_value.
The template parameter <code>T</code> of <code>default_copy</code> may be an incomplete type.

<code>T* operator()(const T& t) const;</code>
* Returns: <code>new T(t);</code>

## X.Y Class template indirect_value [indirect_value]
### X.Y.1 Class template indirect_value general [indirect_value.general]
An indirect_value is an object that owns another object and manages that other object through a pointer. More precisely, an indirect value is an object **v** that stores a pointer to a second object **p** and will dispose of **p** when **v** is itself destroyed (e.g., when leaving block scope (9.7)). In this context, **v** is said to own **p**.

An indirect_value object is empty if it does not own a pointer.

Copying a non-empty indirect_value will copy the owned object so that the copied indirect_value will have its own unique copy of the owned object.

Copying from an empty indirect_value produces another empty indirect_value.

Copying and disposal of the owned object can be customised by supplying a copier and deleter.

The template parameter T of indirect_value must be a non-union class type.

The template parameter T of indirect_value may be an incomplete type.

*[Note: Implementations are encouraged to avoid the use of dynamic memory for ownership of small objects.]*

### X.Y.2 Class template indirect_value synopsis [indirect_value.synopsis]

```
    template <class T, class C = std::default_copy<T>, class D = std::default_delete<T>>
    class indirect_value {
    public:
        using element_type = T;
        // Constructors
        constexpr indirect_value() noexcept;
        explicit indirect_value(T* p, C c=C{}, D d=D{});

        indirect_value(const indirect_value& p);
        indirect_value(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;

        // Destructor
        ~indirect_value();

        // Assignment
        indirect_value& operator=(const indirect_value& p);
        indirect_value& operator=(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;

        // Modifiers
        void swap(indirect_value<T>& p) noexcept;

        // Observers
        T& operator*();
        T* operator->() noexcept;
        const T& operator*() const;
        const T* operator->() const noexcept;
        explicit operator bool() const noexcept;
    };

    // indirect_value creation
    template <class T, class ...Ts> indirect_value<T>
    make_indirect_value(Ts&& ...ts);

    // indirect_value specialized algorithms
    template<class T>
    void swap(indirect_value<T>& p, indirect_value<T>& u) noexcept;

} // end namespace std

```

### X.Y.3 Class template indirect_value constructors [indirect_value.ctor]

<code>constexpr indirect_value() noexcept;</code>
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.
* Effects: Constructs an empty indirect_value.
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == false

<code>explicit indirect_value(T* p, C c=C{}, D d=D{});</code>
* Effects: Creates an indirect_value object that owns the pointer p. If p is non-null then the copier and deleter of the indirect_value constructed are moved from c and d.
* Requires: C and D satisfy the requirements of CopyConstructible. If p is non-null then the expression c(*p) returns an object of type T*. The expression d(p) is well-formed, has well-defined behaviour, and does not throw exceptions. 
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == bool(p).
* Remarks: A custom copier and deleter are said to be ‘present’ in a polymorphic_value initialised with this constructor.

<code>indirect_value(const indirect_value& p);</code>
* Effects: Creates a polymorphic_value object that owns a copy of the object managed by p. The copy is created by the copier in p. If p has a custom copier and deleter then the custom copier and deleter of the indirect_value constructed are copied from those in p.
* Throws: Any exception thrown by the copier or bad_alloc if required storage cannot be obtained.
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == bool(p).

<code>indirect_value(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;</code>
* Effects: Move-constructs an indirect_value instance from p. If p has a custom copier and deleter then the copier and deleter of the indirect_value constructed are the same as those in p.
* Postconditions: *this contains the old value of p. p is empty.
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.

### X.Y.4 Class template indirect_value destructor [indirect_value.dtor]
<code>~indirect_value();</code>
* Effects: If get() == nullptr there are no effects. If a custom deleter d is present then d(p) is called and the copier and deleter are destroyed. Otherwise the destructor of the managed object is called.

### X.Y.5 Class template indirect_value assignment [indirect_value.assignment]
<code>indirect_value& operator=(const indirect_value& p);</code>
* Effects: *this owns a copy of the resource managed by p. If p has a custom copier and deleter then the copy is created by the copier in p, and the copier and deleter of *this are copied from those in p. Otherwise the resource managed by *this is initialised by the copy constructor of the resource managed by p.
* Throws: Any exception thrown by the copier or bad_alloc if required storage cannot be obtained.
* Returns: *this.
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == bool(p).

<code>indirect_value& operator=(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;</code>
* Effects: Ownership of the resource managed by p is transferred to this. If p has a custom copier and deleter then the copier and deleter of *this is the same as those in p.
* Returns: *this.
* Postconditions: *this contains the old value of p. p is empty.
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.

### X.Y.6 Class template indirect_value modifiers [indirect_value.modifiers]
<code>void swap(indirect_value<T>& p) noexcept;</code>
* Effects: Exchanges the contents of p and *this.
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.

### X.Y.7 Class template indirect_value observers [indirect_value.observers]
```
T& operator*();
const T& operator*() const;
```
* Requires: bool(*this).
* Returns: A reference to the owned object.

```
T* operator->() noexcept;
const T* operator->() const noexcept;
```
* Requires: bool(*this).
* Returns: A pointer to the owned object. 
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.

<code>explicit operator bool() const noexcept;</code>
* Returns: false if the polymorphic_value is empty, otherwise true.
* Remarks: The method shall work with incomplete pointer type for T.
