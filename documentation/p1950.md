# Abstract
Add a class template, indirect_value, to the standard library to support indirect objects with value-like semantics.

# Introduction
The class template, indirect_value, confers value-like semantics on a freestore allocated object. A indirect_value may hold an object of a class T, copying the indirect_value will copy the object of T, and constness will propagate from the owning classes to the indirect_value type.

## Motivation
In C++, when anything in a class definition changes
The Pimpl idiom has become a well known engineering paradigm in the C++ world

## Completeness
Recommended practice for implementation of a Pimpl classes since C++11 has been to store the Pimpl in a std::unique_ptr [H.Sutter] and [S.Meyers]. Smart pointer types in the Standard Library expect that some of the members can be instantiated with incomplete types [H.Hinnant]. Similarly this is the case for indirect_value.

# Technical specifications

## X.X Class template default_copy [default.copy]
```
namespace std {
    template <class T>
    struct default_copy {
        T* operator()(const T& t) const;
    };
} // namespace std
```
The class template default_copy serves as the default copier for the class
template polymorphic_value.
The template parameter <code>T</code> of <code>default_copy</code> may be an incomplete type.

<code>T* operator()(const T& t) const;</code>
* Returns: <code>new T(t);</code>

## X.Y Class template indirect_value [indirect_value]
### X.Y.1 Class template indirect_value general [indirect_value.general]
An indirect_value is an object that owns another object and manages that other object through a pointer. More precisely, an indirect value is an object **v** that stores a pointer to a second object **p** and will dispose of **p** when **v** is itself destroyed (e.g., when leaving block scope (9.7)). In this context, **v** is said to own **p**.

An indirect_value object is empty if it does not own a pointer.

Copying a non-empty indirect_value will copy the owned object so that the copied indirect_value will have its own unique copy of the owned object.

Copying from an empty indirect_value produces another empty indirect_value.

Copying and disposal of the owned object can be customised by supplying a copier and deleter.

The template parameter T of indirect_value must be a non-union class type.

The template parameter T of indirect_value may be an incomplete type.

*[Note: Implementations are encouraged to avoid the use of dynamic memory for ownership of small objects.]*

### X.Y.2 Class template indirect_value synopsis [indirect_value.synopsis]

```
    template <class T, class C = std::default_copy<T>, class D = std::default_delete<T>>
    class indirect_value {
    public:
        using element_type = T;
        // Constructors
        constexpr indirect_value() noexcept;
        explicit indirect_value(T* p, C c=C{}, D d=D{});

        indirect_value(const indirect_value& p);
        indirect_value(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;
        indirect_value(T&& t);

        // Destructor
        ~indirect_value();

        // Assignment
        indirect_value& operator=(const indirect_value& p);
        indirect_value& operator=(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;

        // Modifiers
        void swap(indirect_value<T>& p) noexcept;

        // Observers
        T& operator*();
        T* operator->();
        const T& operator*() const;
        const T* operator->() const;
        explicit operator bool() const noexcept;
    };

    // indirect_value creation
    template <class T, class ...Ts> indirect_value<T>
    make_indirect_value(Ts&& ...ts);

    // indirect_value specialized algorithms
    template<class T>
    void swap(indirect_value<T>& p, indirect_value<T>& u) noexcept;

} // end namespace std

```

### X.Z.3 Class template indirect_value constructors [indirect_value.ctor]

<code>constexpr indirect_value() noexcept;</code>
* Effects: Constructs an empty indirect_value.
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == false

<code>explicit indirect_value(T* p, C c=C{}, D d=D{});</code>
* Effects: Creates a indirect_value object that owns the pointer p. If p is non-null then the copier and deleter of the indirect_value constructed is moved from c and d.
* Requires: C and D satisfy the requirements of CopyConstructible. If p is non-null then the expression c(*p) returns an object of type T*. The expression d(p) is well formed, has well defined behavior, and does not throw exceptions. 
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == bool(p).
* Remarks: A custom copier and deleter are said to be ‘present’ in a polymorphic_value initialised with this constructor.

<code>indirect_value(const indirect_value& p);</code>
* Effects: Creates a polymorphic_value object that owns a copy of the object managed by p. The copy is created by the copier in p. If p has a custom copier and deleter then the custom copier and deleter of the indirect_value constructed are copied from those in p.
* Throws: Any exception thrown by the copier or bad_alloc if required storage cannot be obtained.
* Postconditions: bool(*this) == bool(p).

<code>indirect_value(indirect_value&& p) noexcept;</code>
* Remarks: The second constructor shall not participate in overload resolution unless U* is convertible to T*.
* Effects: Move-constructs a indirect_value instance from p. If p has a custom copier and deleter then the copier and deleter of the indirect_value constructed are the same as those in p.
* Postconditions: *this contains the old value of p. p is empty.
