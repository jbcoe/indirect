# Abstract
Add a class template, indirect_value, to the standard library to support indirect objects with value-like semantics.

# Introduction
The class template, indirect_value, confers value-like semantics on a freestore allocated object. A indirect_value may hold an object of a class T, copying the indirect_value will copy the object of T, and propagation of constness will propagate from the owning classes to the indirect_value type.

## Motivation

## Completeness
Recommended practice for implementation of a Pimpl classes since C++11 has been to store the Pimpl in a std::unique_ptr [H.Sutter] and [S.Meyers]. Smart pointer types in the Standard Library expect that some of the members can be instantiated with incomplete types [H.Hinnant]. Similarly this is the case for indirect_value.
